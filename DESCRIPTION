 Description: An implementation of the Balancing Walk Design (BWD) for online experimental 
    design as described in Arbour, Dimmery, Mai and Rao (2022) <arXiv:2203.02025>.
    The Code-Implementation is taken from the Python Package "balancer-package",
    which you can find here: https://github.com/ddimmery/balancer-package
    The package provides algorithms (BWD, BWDRandom, MultiBWD) to reduce variance 
    in randomized experiments by maintaining covariate balance in a streaming setting.
    To this it adds a state-agnostic way of using the algorithm in the formr-framework.
